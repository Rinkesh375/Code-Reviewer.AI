/*
GitHub OAuth Scopes – Notes

Scope meanings and what permissions they grant:

- read:user
  Allows the app to read the user's basic GitHub profile information
  (username, avatar, profile details).

- user:email
  Allows the app to access the user's email address
  (useful when email is not public).

- repo
  ⚠️ Powerful permission.
  Allows full access to the user's repositories
  (both public and private), including reading, writing,
  creating repos, issues, PRs, and commits.

- public_repo
  Allows access only to public repositories.
  Safer alternative to "repo" if private repo access is not needed.

- workflow
  Allows the app to manage and interact with GitHub Actions workflows
  (trigger runs, read workflow status, etc.).

- admin:repo_hook
  Allows management of repository webhooks
  (create, update, delete webhooks for repo events).
